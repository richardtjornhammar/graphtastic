# Group Factor Analysis Code
Decomposes a set of expressions into a group expression
and calculates how it is regulated via an ANOVA that is
relating it to the observables in the journal file. The
final p values are then fdr corrected and the resulting
q values are also calculated.

The journal and analyte expression file must be ordered
the same way with respect to the samples that are
positioned on the columns.
