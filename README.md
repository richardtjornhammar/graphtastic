# Simple Group Factor Analysis
Decomposes a set of expressions into a group expression.
The expression regulation can be studied via an ANOVA that
relates it to the observables in the journal file. The
final p values are then FDR corrected and the resulting
q values are produced.

The journal and analyte expression file must be ordered
the same way with respect to the samples that are
positioned on the columns.
