Description: # Simple Group Analysis
        Decomposes a set of expressions into a group expression.
        The toolkit currently offers enrichment analysis, hierarchical
        enrichment analysis, PLS regression, Shape alignment or clustering
        as well as  rudimentary factor analysis.
        The expression regulation can be studied via a statistical
        test that relates it to the observables in the journal file.
        The final p values are then FDR corrected and the resulting
        adjusted p values are produced.
