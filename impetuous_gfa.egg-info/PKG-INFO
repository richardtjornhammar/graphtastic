Description: # Simple Group Analysis
        Decomposes a set of expressions into a group expression.
        The toolkit currently offers enrichment analysis, hierarchical
        enrichment analysis, PLS regression and rudimentary factor analysis.
        The expression regulation can be studied via a statistical
        test that relates it to the observables in the journal file. 
        The final p values are then FDR corrected and the resulting
        adjusted p values are produced.
        
        The journal and analyte expression file must be ordered
        the same way with respect to the samples that are
        positioned on the columns.
